    // on the first, the two menus and the two flyouts on the second (see
    // SettingsSchema.scrambleSectionChips). There was a master on/off over
    // them; it said nothing that unticking all of them doesn't, and two
    // switches for one effect only raised the question of which was in charge
    // (an old config's "off" folds into the chips - see Settings.heal).

    // other. The slack that buys falls inside whichever column's word is the
    // shorter of its pair.

    // It is also the one row whose preview isn't a picture standing under it:
    // the chips are the preview (see ChipRow's scramblePreview). Every other
    // setting here is a motion done *to* something, so a preview has to draw
    // that something; this one is done to text, and the words naming the
    // surfaces are already text sitting right where the user is looking. A
    // sample card under them said the same thing twice, in a second place, and
    // still had to be told to run when every box was off.

// The client-side stand-in for compositor blur ("xray", see Settings.bgBlur),
// deliberately a sibling of the launcher's content rather than a child of it:
// the compositor blur it imitates is a solid backdrop that the reveal circle
// uncovers, where content fades up from nothing over the same animation.
// Inside content it inherited that fade and read as a backdrop dissolving in -
// the one visible difference left between the two modes.
//
// Takes the same mask as content, so it is revealed by exactly the same
// circle, and in "fade"/"none" styles it simply appears with the window -
// which is also what the compositor's blur region does there.

    // at 64, which is a sigma of about 8 against niri's 19, so this
    // is as wide a blur as the effect has. Saturation matches
    // exactly though - MultiEffect's saturation is an adjustment
    // around 0, so 0.5 is niri's `saturation 1.5`, the same mix
    // toward luma.

// ---------- custom page contract ----------
// pibble hands one of these to every custom page's root item, as a
// `pibble` property, if the page declares one. Every member below is
// optional - use whichever ones you want.
//
// Why this exists: a page can't otherwise know things only the launcher
// keeps track of - which pane is showing, what's being typed, where
// keyboard focus is - or reproduce the launcher's own tile-pop-in
// animation and colors by hand. This is that missing piece.
//
// It's not a sandbox. A page can `import "root:/config"` or
// `"root:/services"` and reach shell internals directly if it really
// wants to - nothing stops it. The difference is that only the members
// below are promised to keep working after a pibble update; anything
// reached by importing shell internals directly can break silently
// (there's no compile step, so a broken reference just shows up as a
// runtime warning, not a build error).
//
// No icon glyphs here - pibble's own icon codepoints (which glyph means
// what) are an internal detail of how pibble draws itself, not
// something a page should depend on. A page that wants icons uses
// `iconFont` below (pibble's own vendored font, already loaded) or
// loads its own font, then finds the codepoints it needs by opening
// that font in a codepoint viewer like FontForge - see
// calendar.example's chevron buttons for a worked example.
//
// A page sizes itself: pibble just centers a window around whatever
// width/height the page reports (420x320 if it reports none) - nothing
// clips, so a page that's too big just overlaps.
//
// Pages can also hand something back to pibble, the other direction:
// a `settingsTab` Component property on the same root item gives the
// page its own tab in Settings, labeled after the page's folder name.

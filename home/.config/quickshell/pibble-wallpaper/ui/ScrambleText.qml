// A Text whose string resolves out of a run of random glyphs every time it
// arrives - a pane opening, a tile springing back in behind a widening
// filter - off Anim's shared scramble clock (see the block at the foot of
// Anim.qml for the clock itself). A label whose *string* is what changed while
// it sat there, rather than the label itself arriving, opts in with
// `replayOnChange` below.
//
// Callers bind the real string to `content`, not to `text`: `text` is what
// the effect renders, so binding it at the call site and having the effect
// write it would tear that binding down on the first frame of the first run.
// Everything else is a plain Text - font, color, elide, wrapping and anchors
// all behave exactly as they do on one.
//
// Each label starts its own run the moment it is actually on screen, rather
// than all of them starting together when the clock does. That is what keeps
// the effect in step with whatever brought the label in: a tile's caption
// waits out that tile's stagger and entrance spring, and under a "grow"
// launch every label waits for the reveal circle to reach it. A shared start
// with fixed offsets can't do either - the offsets have to guess at the
// entrance, and anything the guess is late for arrives with its text already
// resolved.

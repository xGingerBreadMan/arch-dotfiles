// The power-off prompt arming: the screen dimming and sinking away, the ring
// riding down from the top edge *stroking itself closed as it comes*, and the
// prompt landing under it once the ring is all but shut. The keybind plays
// exactly this on the real thing (LauncherState.playPower drops powerRaw
// straight to the threshold and lets its Behavior ride it down), so the preview
// replays the keybind's version rather than a drag nobody can perform against a
// 100px box.
//
// The ring is a Canvas because the arc is what carries the gesture: a circle
// that simply appears says nothing about how far along the prompt is, so it
// strokes itself closed as the pull comes down and lands as a plain closed
// circle. The prompt under it is a bar, as every other stand-in for text in
// these previews is - the words are the power row's business, not this
// setting's, and at this size they were a smear of glyphs either way.
//
// Every duration goes through Anim.power(), the same switch this row sets. The
// reboot prompt is this mirrored around the bottom edge; one of the two is
// enough to read the setting.

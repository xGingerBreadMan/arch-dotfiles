## Configuring

### Settings
pibble has an extensive in-app settings page (`Ctrl+S` to open) covering appearance, animations, resource usage, layouts, navigation and flyouts.

### Namespaces

Each window has a layer-shell namespace which can be used to apply background effects/animations in your compositor's configuration file.

| Namespace | Window |
|---|---|
| `pibble-launcher` | Main launcher |
| `pibble-notifications` | Notification flyout |
| `pibble-volume` | Volume flyout |

### Custom pages

Custom page API coming.

<!--
To add your own page to pibble, create a folder within `custom-pages/` that contains a `main.qml` file. Pibble uses the name of your folder to determine the page name in settings as well as in `./pibble toggle [page]`

```
custom-pages/
└── your-page
    └── main.qml
```

Pibble will render any valid qml, use of the following API is optional. It allows you to sync your page's appearance with pibble's as well as handle settings, animations and text input.     

To use the properties exposed by pibble declare a `pibble` property in your page's root item (pibble will populate this). To define your own settings content, declare a `settingsTab` property in the root item (pibble will read from this).

```qml
Item {
    id: root 
    property var pibble: null
    readonly property Component settingsTab: Component { }
}
```

To access a `pibble` property use `pibble.property` as defined in the table below:


| Property | Type | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `accentColor`, `textColor`, `mutedTextColor` | `color` | current values of `SETTINGS > General > Color theme` |
| `tileColor`, `activeTileColor`, `borderColor` | `color` | ready-mixed colors based on `accentColor` that are used in tiles/buttons |
| `font` | `string` | curent value of `SETTINGS > General > Font` |
| `fontScale` | `real` | current value of `SETTINGS > General > Font size`. It's a multiplier, e.g. `1.2` — turn a size into a real pixel value with `Math.round(px * fontScale)` |
| `iconFont` | `string` | the name of pibble's icon font, you are required to find your own unicode |
| `radius(px)` | function | returns `px` while `SETTINGS > General > Rounded corners` is on and `0` while it's off — bind your corners through it (`radius: pibble.radius(8)`) so your page squares itself alongside the rest of the shell |
| `pageActive` | `bool` | `true` while your page is the one currently showing |
| `launcherOpen` | `bool` | `true` while the launcher is open at all |
| `textInput` | `string` | the current value of pibble's hidden text input |
| `releaseFocus()` | function | call this to give keyboard focus back to pibble if your page took it |
| `tileIn(item, slot, cols)` | function | makes `item` play pibble's tile spawn animation set in `SETTINGS > Animations > Pages` — pass `slot`/`cols` if it's one tile among several, so they can stagger in one after another |
| `setSetting(key, value)` / `getSetting(key, fallback)` | function | save/load your page's settings |

Note: Splitting your page across multiple files requires you to declare `import "." as Local`, then use `Local.Foo {}` instead of plain `Foo {}` to access them.

An example custom-page has been provided at `custom-pages/calendar.example/`. To see it in action remove `.example` from the folder name or upload it via `SETTINGS > Pages > Add a page...`.

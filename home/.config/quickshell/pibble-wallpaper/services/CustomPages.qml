// User-supplied extra pages, discovered from pibble/custom-pages - gitignored,

// against Settings.uploadedPages, so a folder dropped in by hand and one added
// through the Pages settings row's picker are indistinguishable once this runs.
//
// Every page is a top-level directory loaded from <dir>/main.qml - a page can
// be split across as many sibling files as it wants as long as they all live in
// its own directory. Reach them from main.qml with `import "." as Local` and
// `Local.Foo {}` - quickshell's own qmldir synthesis (see quickshell.qmlscanner
// in its logs) shadows the plain-Qt implicit directory import an ordinary QML
// app would get for free, so an unqualified `Foo {}` or bare `import "."`
// silently fails to resolve ("Foo is not a type") even though the file sits
// right there; the qualified form was verified working. A directory with no
// main.qml is surfaced as a disabled, undeletable-by-toggle row instead of
// being silently ignored or half-loaded - see the "broken" handling below.
//
// counter.example/ - the shipped, tracked example - is a real directory page
// under a *.example name, which is the convention for a template that shouldn't
// show up as a real, toggleable row (see the scan below); copy it out from
// under that suffix to actually try it.
